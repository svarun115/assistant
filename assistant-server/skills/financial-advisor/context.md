## Goals

Established: 2026-02-14

### 1. FIRE at 45 (Primary)
- **Target:** Financial independence by age 45 (2040)
- **Definition:** Work optional — enough to sustain lifestyle indefinitely
- **Required portfolio:** ~$2.5-3M at 4% SWR ($100-120K/year NYC expenses)
- **Projected:** ~$5M at 45 (based on $153K/year savings, 7% real returns)
- **Status:** On track. Could achieve earlier (42-43) if markets cooperate.

### 2. Emergency Fund
- **Target:** 6 months NYC expenses (~$35-40K) in USD
- **Current:** ~$10K in Indian bank accounts (INR)
- **Timeline:** Build in first 3 months after US move (from dual paychecks)
- **Status:** Not yet started

### 3. Housing (Conditional)
- **US:** Maybe, depends on greencard / long-term residency prospect
- **India:** Unlikely (low rental yields, not a good investment)
- **Action:** No specific planning needed now. Revisit after immigration status clarifies.

### 4. MSFT Trimming
- **Target:** Reduce MSFT from 50% to ≤35% of portfolio over time
- **Strategy:** Sell on rallies, not panic sells. Diversify into US index funds (S&P 500 / total market).
- **Inflow pressure:** ~$31K RSU + ~$35K ESPP = $66K/year in MSFT stock. Must actively trim.
- **ESPP approach:** Opt in for 10% discount, sell immediately each quarter (~$14K/year free profit)

## Risk Profile

Established: 2026-02-14

**Classification: Moderate-Aggressive / Strategic Rebalancer**

- Won't panic sell on sector-wide drops — holds and waits
- For MSFT-specific drops: waits for normalization/rally, then sells on the rally to trim
- Comfortable with equity-heavy allocation given 14-year FIRE horizon
- Differentiates between systemic vs idiosyncratic risk
- No kids planned (DINK) — can absorb higher risk

## Asset Allocation Targets

Established: 2026-02-14

| Asset Class | Target | Current (Jan 2026) | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| MSFT Stock | 25% | 50% | Trim on rallies + sell RSUs/ESPP immediately |
| US Equity (ex-MSFT) | 20% | 0% | Build from zero post-move (VTI/VOO) |
| Indian Equity | 20% | 37% → 20% post-restructuring | Direct equity baskets + PMS only (no MFs) |
| India Debt (EPF + PPF + SGBs) | 10% | 11% | Frozen post-move, no new India debt |
| US Debt (Treasuries / BND) | 5% | 0% | Build post-move |
| Gold & Commodities | 15% | 2% | Build up in US via GLD/IAU/SLV |
| Cash — India | 1% (~₹6.5L) | 1% (₹9L) | India-side expenses |
| Cash — US | 2% (~$14K) | 0% ($0) | 3 months NYC expenses |
| Crypto | 2% | 1% | Small speculative position |
| **Total** | **100%** | | |

**Post-move investing:** New investments should go into US-domiciled funds (no PFIC risk). US index funds, US-listed ETFs for international exposure.

## Tax Strategy

Established: 2026-02-14

### India (FY 2025-26)
- Tax regime: **New regime** (no 80C or other deductions)
- LTCG: ₹1.25L exemption on equity MFs per year
- Income tax TDS YTD (through Jan 2026): ₹15,06,632
- Advance tax paid: ₹2,71,880 (Sep ₹1,96,880 + Dec ₹75,000)
- **LTCG tax from MF sales (~₹9.65L) not yet paid** — pay as advance tax by March 15 or self-assessment. Confirm approach with CA.

### PFIC Strategy (DECIDED — execute before mid-March 2026)
- **Decision: Sell ALL NJ mutual funds** (equity + debt + gold/silver MFs = ₹1.44Cr) — PFIC elimination
- **Reinvest ₹46-50L** into 1-2 Indian direct equity baskets (advisor to choose best strategies)
- **Park remaining ~₹85-90L** in savings → transfer to US over 3-6 months
- **No FD** — keep liquid, move to US for emergency fund + index investing
- All reinvestment products confirmed as direct equity baskets (stocks in demat) = NOT PFICs
- **Keeping (NOT PFICs):** CapitalMind PMS (₹49L), NJ Direct Equity (₹7.72L), MOSL Apex (₹10.6L), Crown Value (₹10.7L), Baskets (₹2.75L), SGBs (₹14.59L)
- **Estimated LTCG tax on MF sales:** ~₹9.65L (12.5% on gains, minus ₹1.25L exemption)
- **Action needed:** Execute before ~March 10 (T+3 settlement)

### Gratuity
- **Amount:** ₹13,06,073 (Basic ₹2,26,386 × 15 × 10 years / 26)
- **India tax:** Fully exempt under Section 10(10) — under ₹20L ceiling
- **CRITICAL timing:** Must be received BEFORE becoming US tax resident. US doesn't recognize India's gratuity exemption — if received as US tax resident, taxable at 30-37% ordinary income (~₹3.9-4.8L in US tax). Request HR to expedite payment before departure.
- **Difference:** ~$4-5K saved by receiving pre-move vs post-move

### Indian Advisor's Restructuring Plan (Reviewed 2026-02-14)
- Advisor proposed selling all MFs → reinvesting into 7 different equity basket strategies + ₹25L FD
- **Agreed:** Sell all MFs (PFIC elimination), reinvest in direct equity baskets
- **Disagreed:** Too many strategies (7 → recommended 2-3 max), FD is poor for US tax resident
- **Counter-proposal accepted:** Reinvest ₹50-55L in 1-2 best strategies, park rest for US transfer
- **Fee transparency:** Requested but not yet received. Get exact management fee %, performance fee %, and advisor's cut before committing.

### US Tax (from mid-March 2026)
- Dual-country filing for CY 2026
- FBAR/FATCA reporting for all Indian accounts (EPF, PPF, bank, NJ, CapitalMind, Motilal, etc.)
- EPF/PPF: Interest may be taxable annually under US law
- DTAA (India-US): Prevents double taxation but complex for transition year
- **Cross-border tax specialist (CA + CPA) needed — ENGAGE ASAP**

### ESPP Tax Treatment
- India ESPP: ₹71,945/month deduction (currently active)
- US ESPP: 15% of $211K base at 10% discount = ~$35.2K in stock/year
- Quick-flip strategy: sell immediately each quarter for ~$14K/year guaranteed profit
- No additional MSFT holding period risk
