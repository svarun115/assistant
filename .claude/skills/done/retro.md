## Skill-Specific Retro Notes

Common root causes in done sessions:

- **Wrong field**: Incorrect event type or time format passed to journal agent
- **Redundant calls**: Re-reading cache or agent files when already available
- **Sunk cost**: Retrying journal agent spawn instead of falling back to direct logging
