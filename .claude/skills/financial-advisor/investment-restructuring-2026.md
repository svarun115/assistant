# Investment Restructuring Plan — India to US Transition

**Prepared:** 2026-02-14
**Context:** Internal Microsoft transfer, India → NYC, mid-March 2026. Becoming US tax resident.
**Exchange rate assumption:** ₹91.50 = $1

## Current State (Jan 2026)

| Asset | Value | % |
|-------|-------|---|
| MSFT Stock (~806 shares) | $346,633 | 49.9% |
| NJ Mutual Funds (Equity + Debt + Gold/Silver) | $157,377 (₹1.44Cr) | 22.7% |
| NJ Direct Equity | $8,437 (₹7.72L) | 1.2% |
| CapitalMind PMS | $53,508 | 7.7% |
| MOSL Apex + Crown + Baskets | $26,277 | 3.8% |
| EPF | $41,725 | 6.0% |
| PPF | $17,878 | 2.6% |
| SGBs | $15,945 (₹14.59L) | 2.3% |
| Crypto | $6,313 | 0.9% |
| Bank Savings | $9,870 | 1.4% |
| **Total** | **$694,742** | **100%** |

### Problems

1. **MSFT = 50% of portfolio** — single-stock concentration risk
2. **Indian MFs = PFICs** — punitive US taxation (~37% + interest charges) once US tax resident
3. **No USD emergency fund** — all cash is in INR
4. **Gold/silver in MF form** — also PFICs, must be restructured

## Target Allocation

| Asset Class | Target | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| **MSFT Stock** | 25% | Trim on rallies + sell RSUs/ESPP immediately. Currently 50%. |
| **US Equity (ex-MSFT)** | 20% | S&P 500 / total market index (VTI/VOO). Build from zero post-move. |
| **Indian Equity** | 20% | Direct equity baskets + PMS only. Stocks in demat — no MFs (PFIC). |
| **India Debt** (EPF + PPF + SGBs) | 10% | EPF/PPF frozen post-move. SGBs hold to maturity. No new India debt. |
| **US Debt** | 5% | US Treasury bonds, I-bonds, BND. Build post-move. |
| **Gold & Commodities** | 15% | Build up in US via GLD/IAU/SLV. Currently ~2%. |
| **Cash — India** | 1% (~₹6.5L) | India-side expenses (insurance, taxes, family). |
| **Cash — US** | 2% (~$14K) | 3 months NYC expenses. Build from first US paychecks. |
| **Crypto** | 2% | Small speculative position. |
| | **100%** | |

### Current vs Target

| Asset Class | Current | Target | Gap |
|-------------|---------|--------|-----|
| MSFT Stock | 50% | 25% | **-25%** — trim aggressively |
| US Equity (ex-MSFT) | 0% | 20% | **+20%** — build from zero |
| Indian Equity | 37% (MFs + direct) | 20% | Sell MFs, reinvest ₹50L in direct |
| India Debt (EPF+PPF+SGBs) | 11% | 10% | At target |
| US Debt (Treasuries/BND) | 0% | 5% | **+5%** — build post-move |
| Gold & Commodities | 2% | 15% | **+13%** — biggest gap, build in US |
| Cash — India | 1% (₹9L) | 1% (₹6.5L) | At target |
| Cash — US | 0% ($0) | 2% ($14K) | **Build immediately after move** |
| Crypto | 1% | 2% | Close to target |

## Next Steps

### Pre-Move (Now → Mid-March 2026)

1. **Sell all NJ mutual funds** — equity, debt, gold & silver MFs. Keep NJ Direct Equity and SGBs (not PFICs). Deadline: March 10 (T+3 settlement).

2. **Reinvest ₹50L in direct equity** — 1-2 direct equity basket strategies. No FDs, no pooled funds. All holdings must be individual stocks in demat.

3. **Park remainder in savings** — transfer to US over 3-6 months via LRS wire transfers.

4. **Collect gratuity before departure** — tax-exempt in India only if received before becoming US tax resident.

5. **Pay LTCG tax** — advance tax by March 15 or self-assessment (confirm with CA).

### First 3 Months in US (March → June 2026)

6. **Set up US brokerage** — Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. Open high-yield savings account.

7. **Build USD emergency fund** — from first US paychecks + first India wire transfer.

8. **Transfer India cash to US in batches** — invest in US total market, bonds, and gold ETFs.

9. **Opt into ESPP** — sell immediately each quarter (quick-flip for guaranteed profit).

### Ongoing (July 2026+)

10. **Trim MSFT** — sell RSUs and ESPP shares immediately each quarter. Sell additional shares on rallies. Target: 25% of portfolio.

11. **Monthly US investing** — allocate savings across US equity, debt, and gold to close gaps toward target allocation.

12. **Tax filings** — India FY 2025-26 return (by July 2026). US CY 2026 return + FBAR + FATCA (by April 2027).
